## Overview

When building non-trivial applications with AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, DeepSeek, local Ollama models), developers often encounter three problems:

1. **The Blank Canvas Problem:** Asking an AI to "build a whole app" produces monolithic, fragmented code.
2. **Context Drift:** As the chat progresses, the AI forgets foundational schema and architectural decisions made earlier.
3. **Skipped Phases:** Jumping directly to UI before establishing data contracts, authentication, or error handling.

`build-with-ai` solves this by breaking projects into disciplined, sequential phases (Discovery, Schema, Auth, Core CRUD, Testing, Deployment). It maintains a local context store (`context.json`) and automatically interpolates prior architectural decisions into downstream prompts (`{{decisions.key}}`).

### Core Guarantees
- **Zero API Keys & Zero Cost:** Runs 100% locally in your terminal. No third-party API accounts or rate limits required.
- **Universal Model Compatibility:** Use with any web interface, IDE plugin, or local model.
- **Non-Destructive:** Operates entirely within `.buildwithai/` and never touches or overwrites your application source files.

```bash
npx build-with-ai
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g build-with-ai
```

Initialize a new project:

```bash
npx build-with-ai init
```

## Walkthrough

### 1. Initialize
```bash
npx build-with-ai init
```
Select a template, experience level, and project overview. The `.buildwithai/` workspace is created.

### 2. Generate Prompt (`next`)
```bash
npx build-with-ai next
```
The CLI formats the active step, identifies recommended models and target files, and copies the prompt to your clipboard.

```text
STEP 1/15: Problem Discovery & SaaS Value Proposition
Phase: Discovery
Recommended AI: Claude 3.5 Sonnet / GPT-4o
Target Files: [None]

PROMPT FOR YOUR AI:
------------------------------------------------------------
I am building a SaaS product called "Invoice Tracker".
The concept is: A subscription SaaS for freelancers to automate invoicing.
My experience level is Intermediate.

Act as a SaaS product strategist:
1. Define the primary customer persona.
2. Formulate a 2-sentence value proposition.
------------------------------------------------------------
Prompt copied to clipboard.
```

### 3. Record Decisions (`done`)
Paste the prompt into your AI assistant, review the architectural output, and record the choices:

```bash
npx build-with-ai done
```
Enter decisions for required keys (e.g., `decisions.targetCustomer`, `decisions.coreValueProp`). Decisions are saved to `context.json`, and the project advances to the next step.

### 4. Automatic Context Injection
On subsequent steps, previous decisions are automatically injected into the generated prompt:

```text
STEP 3/15: Technology Stack Selection
Phase: Tech Stack

PROMPT FOR YOUR AI:
------------------------------------------------------------
My experience level is Intermediate and "Invoice Tracker" targets:
[Injected from Step 1: Freelance designers and agencies]

Recommend the optimal production tech stack...
------------------------------------------------------------
```

### 5. Inspect and Modify Decisions (`context` & `set`)
View stored decisions or update any value directly using dot-notation:

```bash
npx build-with-ai context
npx build-with-ai set decisions.database "PostgreSQL with Prisma"
```

### 6. Track Progress (`status` & `resume`)
```bash
npx build-with-ai status
```

```text
PROJECT STATUS: Invoice Tracker
Template:   Modern SaaS MVP
Progress:   [============------------] 47% (7/15 steps)

WORKFLOW STEPS:
  [x] 1. Problem Discovery [Discovery]
  [x] 2. MVP Feature Scoping [Requirements]
  [x] 3. Technology Stack Selection [Tech Stack]
  [x] 4. Database Schema Design [Database]
  [x] 5. API Routes & Server Actions [API]
  [x] 6. Authentication Setup [Authentication]
  [>] 7. Stripe Subscription Integration [Payments] (Current)
  [ ] 8. Transactional Email Pipeline [Email]
```

### 7. Export Documentation (`export`)
```bash
npx build-with-ai export
```
Generates standardized documentation from your build history:
- `README.md` — Project architecture and setup guide.
- `BUILD_LOG.md` — Chronological log of decisions and step history.
- `.buildwithai/CONTEXT.md` — Markdown projection of recorded state.

Use `--out-dir <path>` to export to a custom directory or `--dry-run` to preview output paths.

npx build-with-ai next --json | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -ExpandProperty prompt

# Disable clipboard globally in headless environments
export BUILD_WITH_AI_NO_COPY=1
```

## Architecture & Storage Design

All metadata and state are stored in a self-contained `.buildwithai/` directory within your project root:

```text
my-project/
├── .buildwithai/
│   ├── state.json        # Progress tracking (currentStep, completedSteps, timestamps)
│   ├── context.json      # Structured decisions store (single source of truth)
│   ├── CONTEXT.md        # Formatted markdown view of context.json
│   └── history/          # Archived step responses (step-01.md, step-02.md, ...)
├── src/                  # User application code (never touched by the CLI)
├── README.md             # Generated on export
└── BUILD_LOG.md          # Generated on export
```

### Branch-scoped storage (multi-branch workflows)

By default, all git branches share the single `.buildwithai/` directory. Set `BUILD_WITH_AI_BRANCH_SCOPED=1`
to isolate state per branch:

```bash
export BUILD_WITH_AI_BRANCH_SCOPED=1
```

When enabled, the CLI detects the current git branch and stores that branch's `state.json`, `context.json`
and `history/` under `.buildwithai/branches/<branch-name>/` instead. Branch names are sanitized into a
single safe directory segment (e.g. `feature/auth` becomes `feature-auth`), so they can never escape the
`branches/` directory. When git is unavailable, the directory is not a git repository, or HEAD is detached,
the CLI falls back to the default shared `.buildwithai/` storage. `reset` only clears the current branch's
storage; other branches are left untouched.
